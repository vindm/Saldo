rem  Saldo bootstrap - send THIS file to the operator via Telegram and have her
rem  double-click it. It does NOT touch the old (locked) copy under Documents:
rem  it clones a FRESH copy into C:\Saldo (outside OneDrive, so no file-lock
rem  failures), carries over her config, makes the Desktop icon, and runs the
rem  first update. After this she only ever uses the "Update Saldo" icon.

rem  Delivery note: Telegram sends .bat as a file. On first run Windows may show
rem  "Windows protected your PC" -> click "More info" -> "Run anyway" (or right-
rem  click the file -> Properties -> Unblock before running).
