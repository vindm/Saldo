# One-click update on the operator's Windows laptop

Goal: the operator (Irina) never opens a terminal. She double-clicks one desktop
icon and it pulls the latest engine, applies any pending data migrations,
regenerates the dashboards, and opens today's plan.

All the work is in `tools/update.py` (cross-platform). The Windows pieces are a
thin launcher (`tools/windows/update_saldo.bat`) and a one-time shortcut
installer (`tools/windows/install_shortcut.bat`). The `git pull` runs *inside*
`update.py`, not in the `.bat`, so the launcher never rewrites itself mid-run and
the freshly-pulled `migrate.py` / `generate.py` run as clean subprocesses.

## One-time setup (Dima, on her laptop)

1. The repo is already cloned and working (she pulls today via Git Bash), and
   `config/instance.yaml` points `data.dir` at her real data folder with
   `instance.locale: ru`. Nothing to change there.
2. Make sure **Python** and **Git** are callable from `cmd` (not only Git Bash):
   - In a `cmd` window: `py -3 --version` (or `python --version`) and `git --version`.
   - If Python is missing from PATH, reinstall Python with "Add python.exe to
     PATH" checked. Git installed with the default "from the command line too"
     option is already on PATH.
3. Double-click `tools\windows\install_shortcut.bat` once. It creates an
   **"Обновить Saldo"** icon on the Desktop. (Optional: right-click the icon →
   "Pin to taskbar".)

That's it. From now on she only uses the icon.

## Daily use (the operator)

Double-click **Обновить Saldo**. A window shows progress in Russian
("Скачиваю свежую версию → Применяю миграции → Пересобираю дашборды → Готово"),
the plan opens automatically, and the window stays open so she can read the
result (and screenshot it for Dima if anything looks off).

## What it does, in order

1. `git pull --ff-only` (best-effort: if offline, it keeps the current version
   and says so, then still rebuilds the dashboards).
2. ensures `pyyaml` is installed (no-op if it already is).
3. `engine/migrate.py up --apply` — applies pending state migrations. Every write
   is backed up + atomic + UTF-8-validated and recorded in
   `<data.dir>/journal/schema_migrations.json`; re-running is a no-op.
4. `engine/generate.py` — rebuilds the dashboards (prints `LINT OK`).
5. opens `<data.dir>/dashboards/plan_today.html`.

## Notes / gotchas

- **GitHub access**: the clone uses **HTTPS** (`https://github.com/vindm/Saldo.git`),
  the same way this laptop already pulls. Cached GitHub credentials are reused, so
  it usually does not prompt; if it does, sign in once. (No SSH key is required.)
- **Nothing is destructive**: migrations only reshape state with backups; the
  generator only writes derived `*.html`. `config/instance.yaml` and her data are
  never touched by `git pull` (both are git-ignored / outside the repo).
- **Advanced/testing flags** for `tools/update.py`: `--no-pull`, `--no-open`,
  `--no-pause`.
- **macOS/Linux**: the same `python3 tools/update.py` works; only the desktop
  shortcut is Windows-specific.


## Common problem: "Deletion of directory '...' failed. Should I try again? (y/n)"

This happens with a **manual** `git pull` in Git Bash when Windows refuses to
delete a folder the update removed or restructured (e.g. `workflows/checklists`
moved under `jurisdictions/`). The folder is held open by something:

- **OneDrive** — the repo is under `Documents`, which is usually OneDrive-synced.
  This is the most common cause.
- An open **Explorer** window or **editor** sitting inside the Saldo folder.

Fix it once:

1. In the stuck window press `n` then Enter (or Ctrl+C) to stop the loop.
2. Close any Explorer/editor inside the Saldo folder; pause OneDrive if Documents
   is synced.
3. Reconcile deterministically (safe — data is outside the repo, instance.yaml is
   git-ignored):
   ```
   git reset --hard origin/main
   git clean -fd
   ```

**The desktop icon avoids this loop.** `tools/update.py` runs Git non-interactively
(`stdin` closed, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`) and, if a normal fast-forward fails,
self-heals with `fetch` + `reset --hard @{u}` + `clean -fd` (which never removes
git-ignored files like `config/instance.yaml` or the dashboards). So it won't sit
on a y/n prompt the way a manual `git pull` does.

**Durable fix (recommended): keep the repo out of OneDrive.** Move the clone to a
plain local path, e.g. `C:\Saldo\Saldo-engine`, then re-run
`tools\windows\install_shortcut.bat` from the new location to refresh the desktop
icon. A git repo under an actively-syncing OneDrive folder will keep causing
file-lock failures during updates; a non-synced path eliminates the whole class.
